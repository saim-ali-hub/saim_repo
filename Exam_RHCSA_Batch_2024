Task2: Shrink the filesystem size to 300M. After shrinking if size is between 250 and 300M that is also acceptable.
18. Creating a logical volume and extending it. 
Task1: create a volume group name "vg2" on /dev/sdb2 physical volume, create 300M logical volume "lv2", format with ext4 filesystem, mount it on /app2.
